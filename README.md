## discord api with python

I really like to make bot in discord with python, I know there are lots of other tools and programming languages to do same thing in differ manner, but still python is good to code some of the bots, and I am finding where I can stop with python if I got it I will move on other progrming language.

I think it..
octothorpe mean # that means it used for comenting in python, it got its name by its shape, it has 4 lines with each 2 end points, with 2 parallel pair of lines staying on each other becoming transver ray for each, and yeah that the reason they have 8 end points, so that it called octothorpe
